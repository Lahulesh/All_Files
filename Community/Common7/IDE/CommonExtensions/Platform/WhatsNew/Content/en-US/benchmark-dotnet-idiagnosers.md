The Visual Studio Profiler has recently been enhanced to provide support for BenchmarkDotNet IDiagnosers. These IDiagnosers play a crucial role in the aggregation of diagsessions originating within BenchmarkDotNet scenarios. 
The Benchmark tab offers a visualization of the executed benchmarks.

It also provides the ability to precisely choose a benchmark from the swimlane by a double-clicking on a specific row.

Alternatively, you have the option to navigate to the source file through the right-click context menu. The statistical data is sourced directly from BenchmarkDotNet and is presented in a structured grid format.
