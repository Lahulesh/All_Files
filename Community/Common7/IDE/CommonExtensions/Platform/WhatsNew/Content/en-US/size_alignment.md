In C++, you have the convenience of quickly checking the size and alignment of classes, structs, unions, base types, and enums by hovering over their names. You can hover over the class, struct, or union names anywhere they appear in the code, eliminating the need to scroll and search for their declarations just to access their size and alignment details.
