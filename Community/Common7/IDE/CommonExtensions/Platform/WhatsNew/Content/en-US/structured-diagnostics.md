C++ compiler errors can be long and unwieldy. To address this, weâ€™ve created a new Problem Details window which allows you to navigate compiler errors in a structured way. The Problem Details window can be opened by clicking the Details icon for an entry in the Error List.

Entries in the Problem Details window can be expanded to view nested information about the error from the compiler.
