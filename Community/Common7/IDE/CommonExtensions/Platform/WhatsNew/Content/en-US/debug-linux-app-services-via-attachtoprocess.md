We are excited to unveil a powerful new feature that enables debugging of .NET processes in Linux App Services - via "Attach to Process". 
This feature empowers developers to effortlessly debug and diagnose issues within their running Linux Azure App Services instances.

To attach to a process:

1. Select Debug > Attach to Process (or press Ctrl+Alt+P) to open the Attach to Process dialog box.

2. Check the Connection type. It should be "Microsoft Azure app Service".

3. Set the Connection target to your Linux machine name.

4. Select the correct available process and click "Attach".
